This following information is for USB POV Toy developers and hackers:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

0.If you are new to MPLAB-C18 compiler, first read the user manual (FAQ) and understand how it implements
various features of C. This is very important to avoid few suprises. For example: integer promotion are not
enabled by default, string literals are stored in ROM by default -- hence dereference a pointer to a string
will not yeild the expected results.

1.This application is designed to be as modular as possible. All software drivers (modules like SPI, MMA7544L)
are packaged into its own folders for easy maintanance.

2.Intendation of source files are automatically corrected with QtCreator IDE (Use the latest version)

3.Function names and variables follow a <Modulename>_<variable name> convention. This is to help identify
function/variable belonging to diffrent modules. Use this convention until a better way is standardized. 
QtCreator IDE can be used to refractor code (i.e search and replace variable / function name).

4.SPI and Serial Flash driveris implemented based on USB POV Toy hardware configuration.

5.About Accelerometer data: A calibrated accelerometer is critical for correct functioning. Modify MMA7455L_X_OFFSET
in MMA7455L.h suitably.

6.The display refresh happens adaptively based on the speed of waving. It can be configured to work with fixed frequency
by uncommenting #define POVTOY_FIXED_FREQ_REFESH in POVToy.h. In this case, #define POVTOY_FIXED_FREQ_RELOAD_VALUE need
to be set with the desired reflod value of Timer0.

7. Uncomment / comment #define POVTOY_DISABLE_BIDIRECTIONAL in POVToy.h to use unidirectional display or 
bidirectional display.
