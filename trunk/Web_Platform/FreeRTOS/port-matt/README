This is a port of FreeRTOS, uIP and FatFS to the WebPlatform
============================================================

By Matt Callow Oct 2010

FreeRTOS - V6.0.5
uIP - V1.0
FatFS - R0.08a
Ethernet interface with DMA is from the uIPStack by bonyrown

Current state:
 - Pre-emptive FreeRTOS kernel
 - Ethernet using DMA
 - Fat Filesystem, accessing the micro-SD card
 - TCP/IP stack (uIP) running in a single task with:
   - Web server, serving pages from the SD card
   - dhcp client

The we server reads file from the /WWW directory on the SD card. 
Change the WWW_ROOT #define in httpd.c if you want to change this
Currently, there FAT support is for 8.3 filenames only. 
Therefore, you should create INDEX.HTM in the WW_ROOT of the SD card. This will be the default start page.

On statup, the server will request an IP address via dhcp. The configured IP address is written to the serial port.

TODO:
 - CGI scripts/SSI - actually control something via the web interface!
 - Reduce memory usage
 - work out why we can't send full size segments from httpd
 - Better handling of SD card startup
 - Code cleanup
 - DHCPC - renew lease
 - LFN support?
 - Better logging
 - Telnet?
 - Microchip IP announce protocol?
